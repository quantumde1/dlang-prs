/**
	Compresses a supplied byte array.
	Returns the compressed version of the byte array.
	After you are done with using the byte array returned, you should call the exported function
	clearFiles() to dispose of the leftover memory returned to you.

	Params:
		data             = Pointer to the start of the byte array of the file to decompress.
		length           = The length of the byte array.

		searchBufferSize = (Default: 0x1FFF)
		                   A value preferably between 0xFF and 0x1FFF that declares how many bytes
		                   the compressor visit before any specific byte to search for matching patterns.
		                   Increasing this value compresses the data to smaller filesizes at the expense of compression time.
		                   Changing this value has no noticeable effect on decompression time.

		allocateMemoryPtr = A pointer to a CDECL function that copies a region of memory back to its own
		                    buffer given a pointer and length.
